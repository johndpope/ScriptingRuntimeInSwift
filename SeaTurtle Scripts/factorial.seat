; This program calculates a factorial
; To change the factorial it calculates, change the initial value of x
; For instance, to calculate 20!, change Line 4 to SET x 20
SET x 20 ; the factorial we want to calculate
SET step x ; our loop stepper
SET accumulator 1 ; our result holding accumulator
REPEAT x
	SET accumulator accumulator * step
	SET step step - 1
	PRINT accumulator
END
PRINT "$x! = $accumulator"
